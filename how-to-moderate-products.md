## Overview

Products moderation has 2 major steps:

1.  Moderation of correctness of objective product’s properties (images, name, ingredients list, …)ю
    
2.  Moderation of product’s vegan status.
    

While vegan status is the most important part for us, we still have to try to ensure that product’s objective data is overall fine. If a product has invalid photos or ingredients, then it would be harder/impossible to determine its vegan status.

## Objective product’s properties

Click the link to Open Food Facts, and check that the product there::

*   has a proper packaging photo
    
*   has a proper ingredients photo
    
*   ingredients text is taken from the ingredients photo
    
*   brands, if present, fit the product.
