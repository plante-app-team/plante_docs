First of all, thank you very much for helping out the project! ðŸ™‚

This little document has a few important things to always keep in mind when doing Plante translation, and some general advice.

The main thing which makes a good translation good is that such a translation is not a word-by-word transfer from one language to another.
A good translations rather tranfers the meaning from original text, letting itself to do little rewordings here and there, to make sentances more appropriate for the target language.

Other important things:
- Some of the strings have pieces in triangle brackets (e.g. `<PRODUCT>`, `<SHOP>`). These are placeholders for actual names of some entities - for names of products, for names of shops. Such pieces **should not** be translated, but they should be used in the translated text as if they are some actual names.
- Different languages have different punctuation. Keeping the original (English) text punctiation is not necessary - the appropriate punctuation of the target language should rather be used. For example, the Greek lang uses `;` instead of `?`, different languages use different kinds of quotation marks (`"`, `'`, `Â«`, ...).
