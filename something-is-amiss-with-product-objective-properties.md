### Product does not exist in Open Food Facts

That’s unfortunate!  
To ensure the product is really not present in OFF, you should open the Plante mobile app, and past product’s barcode here:

If the product **is found** by the app, that’s even more unfortunate! It means a terrible bug is present. Make sure to let [blazern](https://plante.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:f35ff0ba-29fc-4df9-bfda-e560044b4179?ref=confluence) know about it, and leave the moderation task for the product to him.

If the product **is not found** by the app, it means it was deleted by an Open Food Facts moderator.  
Click “Erase veg-statuses of the product”, then “Moderated”, then “Send”. It will erase product’s data from our database.

### Product doesn’t have packaging/ingredients photo

It probably _does_ have, but it is displayed only for some of the languages. Click here to see all photos of the product:

If the photo is there, then it should be used for moderation.  
If the photo **is not there**, that means we cannot properly moderate the product and should remove it from Plante’s database (_not_ from the Open Food Facts database).

In the moderation page, click “Erase veg-statuses of the product”, then “Moderated”, then “Send”.

### Product’s photo is bad/obscured

Do not delete the photo from Open Food Facts, it’s against their rules to delete images.

Please consult with fellow teammates - there’s a way to solve the problem, but it’s hard to compose an instruction without a way to verify it right away.
