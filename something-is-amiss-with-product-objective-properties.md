### Product does not exist in Open Food Facts

</details>

That’s unfortunate!  
To ensure the product is really not present in OFF, you should open the Plante mobile app, and past product’s barcode here:

</details>

If the product **is found** by the app, that’s even more unfortunate! It means a terrible bug is present. Make sure to let [blazern](https://github.com/blazern/) know about it, and leave the moderation task for the product to him.

If the product **is not found** by the app, it means it was deleted by an Open Food Facts moderator.  
Click “Erase veg-statuses of the product”, then “Moderated”, then “Send”. It will erase product’s data from our database.

### Product doesn’t have packaging/ingredients photo

It probably _does_ have, but it is displayed only for some of the languages. Click here to see all photos of the product:

</details>

If the photo is there, then it should be used for moderation.  
If the photo **is not there**, that means we cannot properly moderate the product and should remove it from Plante’s database (_not_ from the Open Food Facts database).

In the moderation page, click “Erase veg-statuses of the product”, then “Moderated”, then “Send”.

6\. Click “Save”.

### Product’s photo is bad/obscured

Do not delete the photo from Open Food Facts, it’s against their rules to delete images.

Please consult with fellow teammates - there’s a way to solve the problem, but it’s hard to compose an instruction without a way to verify it right away.
