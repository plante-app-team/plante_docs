## How to check the shop didn’t exist before and **delete** it if it did

Example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJtpA6TpBCQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJtpA6TpBCQ)

Instruction:

1.  Try to find an already existing shop
    
    1.  Check if there’s a shop with same or very similar name near to the new one (most of the time they will be in the same building).
        
    2.  If an older shops is not visible nearby, paste new shop’s name into the search bar - maybe the old shop is not visible on the map for some reason, but will be found through search.
        
2.  If an already-existing shop is found, click on it with the Query Features tool of Open Street Map.
    
3.  Ensure it has a “shop” tag. If it doesn’t, either add it manually in Open Street Map or contact [blazern](https://plante.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:f35ff0ba-29fc-4df9-bfda-e560044b4179?ref=confluence)
    
4.  Copy the Open Street Map URL of the already-existing shop.
    
5.  Paste it into the shop-deletion-and-products-move field of the new shop moderation page.
    
6.  Finish moderation.
    
7.  The newly created shop will be deleted automatically from Open Street Map, all its products will be automatically moved to the already-existing shop.
