### Your email

If you don’t yet have an email “yourname@planteapp.com“, ask [blazern](https://plante.atlassian.net/wiki/people/70121:f35ff0ba-29fc-4df9-bfda-e560044b4179?ref=confluence) to make you one.

### List of ambiguous ingredients

Prepare a list of ambiguous ingredients of the target product in format “Name - why ambiguous”. For example:

*   Calcium lactate - it's always prepared using lactic acid, and lactic acid can be obtained by fermentation of milk.
    
*   Natural flavor and natural smoke flavor - "flavors" can have animal origin.
    
*   …
    

### Jira task

In order for the work to not get lost, create a task for the product on the moderation tasks board: [https://plante.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PA/boards/4](https://plante.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PA/boards/4)  
Please put as much of information into the task as possible. Use existing tasks as examples.

### Message text

Prepare a message for the manufacturer, and put the prepared message to the Jira task. If you haven’t prepared messages for manufacturers before, copy a message from one of the recent tasks and adapt it for your product.

The message must contain:

*   Name and barcode of the target product(s).
    
*   List of ambiguous ingredients with explanation of why the ingredients are ambiguous.
    

### Manufacturer’s contact information

Often it’s the hardest part.

#### Name

First, you should find the manufacturer’s name based on one of:

*   the product’s name and brand (using google),
    
*   the product’s packaging photos,
    
*   information on the websites which sell the product online.
    

If the name couldn’t be found, please consult with the teammates.

When name’s found, you it’s time to find contact information.

#### Contacts

We need either an email address, or a “Contact us” form with input fields on manufacturer’s website.

More often then not manufacturers have a Contacts section on their website. But bigger ones for some reason often purposefully leave out all the contacts from their website.

Sometimes the found manufacturer’s name also has manufacturer’s contact information near it, sometimes it doesn’t.

When it doesn’t you should google the manufacturer’s name and go over found pages. Contact your teammates if nothing helps ![(smile)](https://plante.atlassian.net/wiki/s/-1697350906/6452/f64f6b1f49c9f74f3c74ab2885562c07d422b448/_/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png)

### Send a message

That’s it!

You’ve made a list of ambiguous ingredients, created a Jira task, composed a message, found manufacturer’s contacts - it’s time to send them a message!

It should be noted that not all manufacturers respond to our messages. When a manufacturer is silent for a week, it’s worth sending them a message from a personal email account - maybe our [name@planteapp.com](mailto:name@planteapp.com) addresses go to their Spam folder.

When the response is received or there’s silence after a week, continue product’s moderation based on the general instruction.
