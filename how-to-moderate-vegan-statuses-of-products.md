## Main rule

Ingredients list has a priority over any label put on product’s packaging.  
If the packaging has a “Vegan” label, we should keep that in mind _but we still must go over full moderation process_. Sometimes manufacturers make mistakes.

## Ingredients types.

A product can have 4 types of ingredients:

1.  Vegan ingredient with 100% probability (like soy).
    
2.  Non-vegan ingredient with 100% probability (like milk).
    
3.  Ingredient with unknown vegan status (something exotic or misspelled).
    
4.  Ingredient with ambiguous vegan status (like sugar, glycerin or vitamin D3).
    

If all of product's ingredients are of the type 1 then the product is vegan.  
If any of product's ingredients are of the type 2 then the product is non-vegan.  
If any of product's ingredients are of the type 3 then the product has unknown vegan status.

Type 4 is where the fun begins.

## Ambiguous ingredients.

### Types of ambiguous ingredients

There's a wide range of ambiguous ingredients - some of such ingredients in practice are always vegan (even though historically they used to be harvested from non-vegan sources), some of them in practice are quite often non-vegan.

Also, some manufacturers put ingredients like "cheese flavor" to the ingredients list, without explaining where this flavor came from.

Examples:

*   D3 in food is almost always non-vegan: [https://vegfaqs.com/why-isnt-vitamin-d3-vegan/](https://vegfaqs.com/why-isnt-vitamin-d3-vegan/)
    
*   “Cheese flavor” or just “flavor”
    
*   Sugar: [https://doublecheckvegan.com/ingredients/sugar/](https://doublecheckvegan.com/ingredients/sugar/)
    

And there are a lot of ingredients in between these types.

### How should a product with ambiguous ingredients be moderated?

#### Reliable way

##### For countries where vegan certification is wide-spread (USA, Europe):

1.  Look for a trusted “Vegan” certification label on the packaging: [Trusted vegan certificates](trusted-vegan-certificates.md)
    
2.  Google "is <product name> vegan" - for some products there are public consumer researches of their vegan statuses. For example: [https://veganrussian.ru/chips-tomato-chili-samokat/](https://veganrussian.ru/chips-tomato-chili-samokat/)  
    If such a research exists and its source is trustworthy, we should use the vegan status they came up with and put a link to their research to the product's moderation page.
    

##### For countries where vegan certification is not wide-spread (ex-USSR):

1.  All of the above ^, plus …
    
2.  Look for a custom "Vegan" label on product's packaging.  
    If there's such a label and there were no accidents with wrong labels on products of this manufacturer, then we should trust it.
    
3.  Google the manufacturer - some manufacturers are positioning themselves as vegan-friendly and considered trustworthy by their consumers, but don't put the "Vegan"-label on packaging for some reason
    
4.  **Do not trust** religion-related labels like “Suitable for Orthodox fasting” (“Постный“), such labels do more harm than good.
    

If the approaches described above didn't help, then we have to come up with the vegan status empirically.

#### Empirical way

##### Check ingredients

First of all, please read [Surprisingly non-vegan ingredients](surprisingly-non-vegan-ingredients.md), then return to this list.

Where to verify status of each individual ingredient:

1.  Our list: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ldl4wC9uIEqiMys9ong-OBburLzPc79n-sephp6tmu0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ldl4wC9uIEqiMys9ong-OBburLzPc79n-sephp6tmu0/edit?usp=sharing)
    
2.  Double check vegan: [https://doublecheckvegan.com/](https://doublecheckvegan.com/)
    
3.  Google (please prefer more reliable sources of information like Wikipedia and technological web-pages which describe ingredients manufacturing process).
    

If an ingredient is absent from Our list (and is not something simple like “corn” or “water”), _please add it there_ after you figure out еру ingredient’s vegan status and find sources. This way next product with this ingredient will be moderated quicker.

If all ingredients are vegan or one of them is non-vegan - that’s the product’s vegan status.

##### Contact the manufacturer

If you found some ambiguous/unknown ingredients, the manufacturer should be contacted and asked about the ingredients. Please consult with the teammates if you haven’t done it before, but want to give it a try.  
If you wouldn’t like to get in touch with the manufacturer, you should ask others to do that for you.

[How to contact manufacturers](how-to-contact-manufacturers.md)

If the manufacturer responded and their response clarifies product’s vegan status, then you should put their response to the “Moderator’s comment” field of the product moderation page. Use next format:

```
Manufacturer's response:
"<Copy-paste here the response>"
```

Please remove all potentially personal information from the response. For example, names of the company employees should be leaved out.

Also please select the “Confirmed by manufacturer” moderator veg-status choice reason.

##### The last resort

If the manufacturer didn’t respond or didn’t provide any useful information, then …

*   If all of the ambiguous ingredients are like glycerin - are very rarely non-vegan in practice, then we should mark the product as ambiguous.
    
*   If any of the ambiguous ingredients are like D3 - in practice almost never are vegan, then we should mark the product as non-vegan.
    
*   If an ambiguous ingredient has unknown origin but its name is very suspicious ("meat flavor"), then we should mark the product as non-vegan.
    
*   If all of the ambiguous ingredients are somewhere in between of the extremes described above, such a product should be marked with "ambiguous vegan status".  
    For example, if product's ingredients list has "flavor" in it without its origin, but the product is just apple juice - there are no reason for strong suspicious about the product being non-vegan. But we can't be 99%-100% sure it's vegan either, so it's ambiguous.
    
*   If a moderated product has such an ingredients list that it's hard to come up with a proper vegan status, such a product should be discussed together with teammates to figure out what to do with it and to improve this set of rules.
    

### Other important things

*   It's also important to select a proper vegan status choice reason on the moderation page to explain to users why certain status was chosen.
    
*   If the list of reasons doesn't have the reason you’ve based your moderation on, developers should be informed and they will add the reason to the list.
