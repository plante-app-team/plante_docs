#### Sugar

Sugar can be both vegan and non-vegan, hence it's an "ambiguous" ingredient.  
Generally speaking, sugar can be produced from **sugar beet** and from **sugarcane**:

*   Seems all sugar produced from **sugar beet** is vegan (that's almost all sugar in Russia, I'd bet almost all sugar in Europe too).
    
*   While **cane sugar** can be non-vegan quite often (that's almost all sugar in USA).  
    While sugarcane itself is of course vegan, sugar produced from it is [often filtered though animal bones](https://doublecheckvegan.com/ingredients/sugar/).
    

How to moderate it?

*   Treat all "sugar" in European products as vegan.
    
*   Treat all "sugar" in American products as ambiguous.
    
*   Treat all "cane sugar" as ambiguous too, unless it has words like ["organic" or "unrefined"](https://www.peta.org/living/food/is-sugar-vegan/) .
